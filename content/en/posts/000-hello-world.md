# Greetings
First of all, welcome to my world!

Before anything else, let me introduce myself since we don’t know each other yet. I’d like to share a bit about me and set the tone for this space, shall we?

Well, my name is Adriano, and I’m currently at the end of my Computer Science course. I’ve been working in IT since 2021, and I believe I have something to contribute to the community.

The format of this blog will be quite informal, very much like me, which means:

- I’ll use emojis like a cool uncle.
- I might make some mistakes.
- I’ll use gifs because I love them.

![I love it!](https://media.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExN3JsNW9yY3V5NWI1OHh0aDh0ampmM2ZudXRwZmY1dXE3aGczYmhpayZlcD12MV9naWZzX3NlYXJjaCZjdD1n/VMO6qeIbr7JRLnLTGw/giphy.gif)

Anyway, welcome aboard! To kick things off, let’s take the first step as always:
Sure! Here’s my "Hello, World!":

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

# A Brief Overview of How I "Chose This Field"
I’ve always been fascinated by technology. I was that kid who never left the front of the video game. But IT wasn’t my first choice; I considered several options before choosing Computer Science. To reach that decision, I owe it to Linux, yes, the OS.

## Solving Problems Got Me Here
In 2019, I bought a laptop with Linux. In my mind, everything was fine; I could study, but I didn’t know the small difficulties I would face. Ubuntu wasn’t very user-friendly with its app store, and often I had to install via terminal. Of course, being a newbie, I always researched beforehand. Unfortunately, one day it happened. I don’t remember the exact error, but it was related to `dpkg` (the package manager in Linux). I sought help from an IT professional I knew, and the advice I got was, "search for the error." That blew my mind; I went after a solution and, guess what? I succeeded. This left me so satisfied and excited that I quickly asked for tips on studying programming, and that’s when it all started.

## I Started Programming, Now What?
I began programming by self-studying Java. When I took the entrance exam in 2020, I was focused on getting into the Computer Science course. I had already done a lot of research about degrees in the IT field.

# I Entered College
Throughout the course, I dove deep into this world, completing several bootcamps and courses.

My professional journey began within the university itself in September 2021 when I had the opportunity to work as a Scientific Initiation Scholar (PIBIC). I worked on an Internet of Things (IoT) platform focused on health monitoring, which provided me with valuable immersion in technologies like Python and TensorFlow for Machine Learning, as well as mobile development with Kotlin for Android.

In April 2022, seeking to fit into the field, I landed a position as a Test Analyst. This is where my experience with testing began. I took on more responsibilities and soon became a QA.

Looking for new challenges, in January 2023, I secured an internship as a Full-Stack Developer. I learned a lot about development, working with JavaScript using React and Java with Spring Boot. This experience greatly expanded my view of Java; even though I "hated" it, it was where I found myself.

In February 2024, I was in a (nearly desperate) search for opportunities in the field, so I accepted an offer at a startup as a Junior Full-Stack Developer. However, I soon received responses from other applications I submitted, and I’m currently working as a Junior Backend Developer.

Throughout this journey, I’ve learned a lot and know where I went wrong. And that’s why I’m here—I want to help you!
